The project is written in C# and the framework used is .net core. 
For executing the scripts one needs to have Visual studio 2017 or higher version of the IDE.
These test cases are meant to run on Windows 7 or 10 platforms. 
Nuget packages(Dependencies) used: AventStack Extent Reporter for reporting, OpenQA.Selenium for UI Automation, Nunit for test framework, Chrome and Gecko drivers for respective browsers. Operating system : Window 7,10 etc. Browser recommended with this project : firefox.    
11 test cases are added, out of which 10 are UI Validation test cases which check the presence of important UI elements.
One major test case is responsible to check the functionality of Flight lists if it is available on that day between two cities mentioned explicitly in the script. 
Set up on .net core may require some time as everyone's development set up differs based on the version of Visual Studio installed.
